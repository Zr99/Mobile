# Simple Android Graphic Interface
___
## This project has three objectives: 
* successfully create the Android application,
* use Git from within Android Studio
* learn about and develop the layout of a
responsive Android application.

## Design specs: 
“The School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences (SCMS) is considering
developing an Android application, but before they commit, they want a proof of concept.
They have asked you to develop the landing page for the application. It must include a
background image from the UoW campus, the UoW logo, and some descriptive text about
the School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences. It should also be responsive to screen
size, so that it looks good on majority of screen sizes, and should look good in both portrait
and landscape orientations.” 

### Steps:
* Setup – creating an Android app and using Git
* Android XML layout
* Android styles and values
* Orientation
